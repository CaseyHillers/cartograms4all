## Setting up the Project for Development
1. Have NPM set up on your system
2. `cd app && npm install && cd ..`

Your system is now set up for development. If you plan on working with sass, make sure you run `gulp` within the app directory to have it auto-compile the scss changes into style.css.
> You may need to globally install gulp on your system (`npm install -g gulp`).
